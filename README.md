# Opslane

Opslane is a tool that helps make the on-call experience less stressful.

It reduces alert fatigue by classifying alerts as actionable or noisy and providing contextual information for handling alerts.

## Demo

## Key Features

- **Alert Classification**: Opslane can classify alerts as actionable or noisy using LLMs. We analyze alert history and Slack conversations to determine if an alert is actionable.
- **Slack Integration**: Opslane operates in a Slack channel where a team receives alerts. We provide insights and additional resources for debugging actionable alerts.
- **Analytics**: Opslane provides weekly reporting data for the quality of alerts in a Slack channel. We analyze the pattern of alerts and provide an option to silence noisy alerts directly from Slack.
- **Open Source**: Opslane is open source and welcomes contributions from the community.


## Architecture

Opslane uses a modular architecture designed for efficient alert processing and seamless integration with existing tools:

1. **Alert Ingestion**: Datadog sends alerts via webhooks to our FastAPI server.
3. **FastAPI Server**: The core of our system, processing incoming alerts, interacting with Slack, and managing data flow.
4. **Slack Integration**: Provides a user interface for alert management and interaction.
5. **Database**: Utilizes Postgres with pgvector for storing alert data and embeddings.

Here's a high-level overview of the Opslane architecture:
